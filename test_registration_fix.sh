echo "🔧 Registration & Validation Fix Test Script"
echo "============================================="
echo ""

echo "✅ FIXES IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "--------------------"
echo "1. 🔧 Fixed CORS configuration for registration endpoint"
echo "2. 🔧 Enhanced backend logging for better debugging"
echo "3. 🔧 Fixed confirm password validation timing"
echo "4. 🔧 Added password visibility toggle for confirm password"
echo "5. 🔧 Improved MySQL connection configuration"
echo "6. 🔧 Added proper validation error handling"
echo ""

echo "🧪 TESTING REGISTRATION:"
echo "========================"
echo "📍 Go to: http://localhost:4200"
echo ""

echo "🔍 TEST SEQUENCE:"
echo "1. Click on 'Sign Up' tab"
echo "2. Fill in the form step by step and observe validation:"
echo ""

echo "   🧪 Username Tests:"
echo "   - Leave empty → Should show 'Username is required'"
echo "   - Type 'ab' → Should show character limit error"
echo "   - Type 'valid_user123' → Should be valid"
echo ""

echo "   📧 Email Tests:"
echo "   - Leave empty → Should show 'Email is required'"
echo "   - Type 'invalid-email' → Should show format error"
echo "   - Type 'test@example.com' → Should be valid"
echo ""

echo "   🔒 Password Tests:"
echo "   - Leave empty → Should show 'Password is required'"
echo "   - Type 'weak' → Should show requirements"
echo "   - Type 'StrongPass123!' → Should be valid"
echo "   - Click eye icon → Should toggle visibility"
echo ""

echo "   🔒 Confirm Password Tests:"
echo "   - Leave empty → Should show 'Please confirm your password'"
echo "   - Type different password → Should show 'Passwords do not match'"
echo "   - Type matching password → Should be valid"
echo "   - Click eye icon → Should toggle visibility"
echo ""

echo "   ✅ Form Submission:"
echo "   - Try submitting with errors → Should show validation messages"
echo "   - Fill all fields correctly → Should attempt registration"
echo "   - Check browser Network tab → Should see successful API call"
echo ""

echo "🔍 BACKEND LOGS TO CHECK:"
echo "========================="
echo "Look for these log messages in the backend console:"
echo "- 'Registration attempt for email: xxx'"
echo "- 'Registration successful for email: xxx'"
echo "- Any CORS-related messages should be resolved"
echo "- Database connection should be stable"
echo ""

echo "🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING:"
echo "==================="
echo "If registration still fails:"
echo ""
echo "1. ✅ Check MySQL is running:"
echo "   - Service: MySQL should be active"
echo "   - Database: 'taskmanager' should exist"
echo "   - Credentials: root/prajin@123 should work"
echo ""
echo "2. ✅ Check backend logs for:"
echo "   - Database connection errors"
echo "   - Validation errors"
echo "   - CORS errors (should be fixed now)"
echo ""
echo "3. ✅ Check frontend console for:"
echo "   - Network request errors"
echo "   - CORS errors (should be fixed now)"
echo "   - Validation errors"
echo ""

echo "4. ✅ Restart both applications:"
echo "   - Stop both frontend and backend"
echo "   - Start backend first: cd backend && mvn spring-boot:run"
echo "   - Start frontend: npm start"
echo ""

echo "📊 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:"
echo "====================:"
echo "✅ Confirm password field has visibility toggle"
echo "✅ Validation only shows errors after user interaction"
echo "✅ Password match validation works correctly"
echo "✅ Registration API call succeeds"
echo "✅ Verification email process starts"
echo "✅ No CORS warnings in browser console"
echo "✅ Clear backend logs with registration attempts"
echo ""

echo "🎯 SUCCESS INDICATORS:"
echo "======================"
echo "1. Registration form submits successfully"
echo "2. Backend logs show successful registration"
echo "3. User gets verification email (or console log with code)"
echo "4. No CORS warnings in browser dev tools"
echo "5. Confirm password validation works smoothly"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Ready to test!"
echo "Frontend: http://localhost:4200"
echo "Backend logs: Check terminal running mvn spring-boot:run"
